### *Written report included*

Each of the three simulations has a designated section in `main.py`. Computational parameters (i.e. maximum time, step size) are defined at the beginning of the first section (for the rotating cylinder). Physical parameters (defining the cylinder's properties) can be provided as arguments in the cylinder's initialisation, but it defaults to a set of base values defined in `cyl.py` itself.

Required packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`
- `PIL`
